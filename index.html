        <p>“I love this venue - is was so dope for a Halloween Community party right in Newark! The owner was very understandable and flexible with my schedule as well as supportive with any decorations or props I needed at that time! Definitely looking forward to bringing more magical collaborations to Newark via The Golden 7!”</p>

        <p>“I highly recommend The Golden 7 Venue. I hosted a pop-up shop here.
          The venue was spotless and had everything I needed. The highboy tables
          added a great touch to the event. The owner is great to work with and
          she’s very responsive and professional.”</p>

        <p>“I want to give the biggest thank you to The Golden 7 venue for giving me the great opportunity to host my birthday party/live hip hop show. The event was amazing. This venue gave me the opportunity to easily setup chairs for an audience, tables for food to be cooked and served, an easy to use bar setup, tables for party games, and a table for a DJ setup their speaker is awesome, by the way. With that being said, this space was open enough for a large crowd and to have many other sections for a comfortable and wonderful event and experience. Amina was more than kind by making sure we had the best experience possible. She was very helpful and I found her to be a great communicator who was also active in helping make sure we had a smoothly operated event. The great thing about this open space is the fact that you can easily turn it into having a nightclub feel with some lights or you can have a professional modern feel with natural light from the windows or the room light, which we took advantage of in different portions of the night. Thank you Golden 7 for making it easy and for giving me the experience of a lifetime. Amina was an easy going but responsible host. There is nothing more I could ever ask for!”</p>
